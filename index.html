										Processes and Enhance Decision-Making Analysis.</a></h2>
									<p>Clasen faced significant challenges with their flat file data
										management system. Multiple versions of the same data
										were stored across different departments. Inconsistent data
										entries and formats led to reporting inaccuracies.
										Performance issues arose as the volume of data grew,
										resulting in slow querying and processing times, while the
										lack of a relational structure limited advanced analysis and
										dynamic reporting capabilities. These challenges hindered
										the company's ability to efficiently manage and analyze their
										expanding data, prompting the need for a more robust
										solution. To address these challenges, Clansen decided to
										transition from flat files to a table-based data model
										using Power BI.</p>
